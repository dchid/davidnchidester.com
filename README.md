This repository is a backup and public repository for my personal resume website. You may use my css stylesheet, js files, or any other things I have on my website for free under the GNU public license.

## Dependancies
The website uses Bootstraps as a CSS framework and JQuery for DOM. They're retrieved from a CDN so hosting Bootstrap and JQuery isn't necessary.
