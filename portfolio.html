                                <p>The numeral base converter is a command line utility I designed to convert numbers
                                    between different numeral bases.
                                    For example, it can convert numerals between binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal
                                    but
                                    also more unusal bases (like base 3 for example).
                                    Like Java's Integer.parseInt() method, it will work with any base between 2 and 16
                                    inclusive. This project started as a lab for my architecture
                                    and compilers course at Willamette University, but I've modified it as a CLI
                                    application
                                    designed to be piped to other CLI apps.
                                    Check it out on my Github.

                                    The longest common DNA subsequence started as a project in my algorithms course
                                    which
                                    has since been expanded It can find the longest common subsequence between two DNA
                                    sequences,
                                    find compliment bases, and convert DNA to Messenger RNA. I've found this project
                                    particularily
                                    interesting after I started working in biotech.

                <p><br>Back in 2016, I was fortunate enough to take a 3D animation class at Willamette University.
                    There, I learned how to model, light, rig, and animate in Autodesk Maya.
                    Here, you can see the work I did in that class, learning the basics of 3D animation.

                <h4 class="centered_text">The Apple</h4>
                <p><u>The Apple</u> was my final project in my 3D animation class. While several people have told me
                    that this video is a little dark, in my defense I just animated it;
                    someone else wrote it. That said, it was a challenging but enjoyable project to work on with three
                    other classmates, which taught us to animate as a team. Enjoy!</p>

                <p>This animation was a collaberative effort with one other student. We've all had annoying roommates at
                    one
                    point or another. Sometimes, we all just want them to pipe down.

                </video>
                <p>Unlike the two animations above, this one was a solo effort. I wanted to make a really cool looking
                    sword and
                    have it slice stuff. There's not a lot more to it than that.

                <p>This lego animation was one of the earliest projects I did in my animation class. Our assignment was
                    inspired by the famous Pixar animation <u>Luxo Jr.</u>, where students
                    were to give life and character to inanimate objects. While the folks at Pixar chose a lamp for Luxo
                    Jr., I chose my favortie toy as a child: Legos! The animation is a loop.</p>
