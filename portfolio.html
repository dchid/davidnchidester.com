                                <p>The numeral base converter is a command line utility I designed to convert numbers
                                    between different numeral bases. For example, it can convert numerals between binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal
                                    but also more unusual bases (like base 3 for example). Like Java's Integer.parseInt() method, it will work with any base between 2 and 16
                                    inclusive. This project started as a lab for my architecture and compilers course at Willamette University, but I've modified it as a CLI
                                    application designed to be piped to other CLI apps. Check it out on my Github.

                                    The longest common DNA subsequence started as a project in my algorithms course
                                    which has since been expanded It can find the longest common subsequence between two DNA
                                    sequences, find compliment bases, and convert DNA to Messenger RNA. I've found this project
                                    particularly interesting after I started working in biotech.

			        At Thermo Fisher Scientific, I collaborated with other software engineers to make it easier to request resources to be provisioned.
			        We created a resource provisioning request form with Microsoft PowerApps and published <a class="text-light"href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/modernizing-with-aws/thermo-fisher-integrated-microsoft-with-aws/" target="blank">details of our work</a> on the AWS Blog.
				We integrated the PowerApp with AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda to create an automated self service platform.

			        Data engineering teams at Thermo Fisher Scientific needed a tool to migrate CSV files in Microsoft SharePoint into their S3 datalake.
				I created a custom python module to automate the process using Microsoft's Graph API and the AWS S3 SDK.
				The project saved data engineering teams over 250 hours of labor annually. I co-authored a blog post on the project on the official AWS blog

            <div id="animation_tab" class="tab-pane bg-dark">
                <p><br>Back in 2016, I was fortunate enough to take a 3D animation class at Willamette University.
                    There, I learned how to model, light, rig, and animate in Autodesk Maya.
                    Here, you can see the work I did in that class, learning the basics of 3D animation.
                </p>
                <h4 class="centered_text">The Apple</h4>
                <p><u>The Apple</u> was my final project in my 3D animation class. While several people have told me
                    that this video is a little dark, in my defense I just animated it;
                    someone else wrote it. That said, it was a challenging but enjoyable project to work on with three
                    other classmates, which taught us to animate as a team. Enjoy!</p>

                </video>
                <p>This animation was a collaberative effort with one other student. We've all had annoying roommates at
                    one
                    point or another. Sometimes, we all just want them to pipe down.

                    <source src="video/Roommate.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>Unlike the two animations above, this one was a solo effort. I wanted to make a really cool looking
                    sword and
                    have it slice stuff. There's not a lot more to it than that.

                <p>This lego animation was one of the earliest projects I did in my animation class. Our assignment was
                    inspired by the famous Pixar animation <u>Luxo Jr.</u>, where students
                    were to give life and character to inanimate objects. While the folks at Pixar chose a lamp for Luxo
                    Jr., I chose my favortie toy as a child: Legos! The animation is a loop.</p>
