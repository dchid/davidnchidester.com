            It has been a very long time since I posted to this blog, but not because I haven’t been working on
            interesting projects. Many readers of my blog have been aware of my work at the Museum of Art and Digital
            Entertainment (MADE) in video game preservation. Over these past few months, I’ve completed what has been my
            most complex and technically involved project to date; the PS-Placeable exhibit, a Sony PlayStation Portable
            turned into a console, with 118 games loaded onto it. I’d like to share not only how I created this exhibit,
            but why it’s important in the first place.
        </p>
        <p class="blog_paragraph">
            In 2019 I had the privilege of attending the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco as a student,
            where Video Game History Foundation founder, Frank Cifaldi, gave his 
            <a href="https://gdcvault.com/play/1025782/It-s-Still-Emulation-Saving" target="blank">second presentation</a> 
            at GDC on emulation as a tool for game preservation as a follow up to his
            <a href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1023470/-It-s-Just-Emulation" target="blank">first presentation in 2016</a>.
            To summarize what Frank said, emulation is simply a piece of software that makes one computer behave like a
            different computer, and the gaming industry should use it as a tool to keep games in print indefinitely, 
            just like how you can still watch a nearly 90 year old film like The Wizard of Oz today, without getting a 
            70mm film print and century old film projector.
        </p>
        <p class="blog_paragraph">
            However, emulation alone isn’t sufficient. Even though you can watch The Wizard of Oz online, the original
            films should still be archived and preserved, and likewise, there should be the video game equivalent of a
            film archive; a place where you can experience old games exactly as they were played on their original
            hardware. Thankfully, there is such a place.

            I’ve been volunteering with the Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment (MADE) to digitize their collection
            and get more games in their collection on public exhibition. The MADE didn’t have any PlayStation Portable
            (PSP) games on display, so I worked on digitizing the MADE’s PSP collection, and putting them on a PSP
            that’s been converted from handheld to a console.
        </p>
        <p class="blog_paragraph">
            The first step was to rip the files off of PSP discs, and put them on a memory card. PSP games came on
            proprietary Universal Media Discs (UMD), so I couldn’t just use any old CD drive to copy the data from the
            discs. Instead I had to modify the firmware on a PSP to turn the PSP itself into a disc ripping tool. Once
            this was done, I put a barcode on each disc so I could match each game ROM with the disc it was copied from.
            Finally, I plugged the firmware modified PSP into a computer via USB to copy the files off each disc. It
            took several weeks, but I managed to digitize 118 PSP games in the MADE’s collection, and put them on a
            memory card.
        </p>
        <p class="blog_paragraph">
            With the software solution complete, I moved onto the hardware. A project called the PS-Placeable allows
            PSPs to be turned into a home console. I bought the necessary materials for the build and got to work. The
            PSP had video output, but no bluetooth to connect a controller. To mitigate this, I flashed bluetooth
            firmware on a circuit board and soldered it to the PSP’s motherboard. This allowed the PSP to accept input
            from a controller. I tidied everything up by putting it into a 3D printed case that resembles a PS2. With
            everything complete, I loaded the games onto the PS-Placeable, and hooked it up to a display.

            This project was a lot of work, but the end result was more than worthwhile. No one should need to spend
            hundreds or even thousands of dollars on vintage games and hardware to experience games from previous
            decades, and we can’t just let them fade into obscurity. Video games are a unique artistic medium combining
            other art forms such as visual art, music and storytelling, to turn them into an interactive experience. Old
            games should be preserved not only to indulge nostalgia, but for the sake of historical preservation, to
            enable future generations to experience them. If you ever are in downtown Oakland CA, I strongly recommend
            visiting the MADE. They’re one of the only museums in the world preserving games through playable
            exhibitions.

            Thank you to Dan and Stephen from RetroModWorks for creating the PS-Placeable project, thank you to Nate
            Ferrell for printing the case and helping with the build, and thank you to Kilian Fitzgerald for donating
            the PSP which I used for this project.
