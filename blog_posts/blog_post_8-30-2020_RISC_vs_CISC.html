            its dominance. Apple has announced that after years of using Intel CPUs in it’s Macintosh computers, it will
            soon be making the switch to ARM. Indeed, this is a big blow to team blue, especially after they’ve already lost
            the gaming console market to AMD, and continue to lose more and more of the PC market to them each year.
            Even though Apple was a key customer of Intel’s they simply couldn’t deliver the low power consumption that
            Apple craved for it’s ever slimmer and lighter devices. It’s quite ironic, as low power consumption was
            originally what helped Intel win over Apple’s partnership in the early 2000’s, when they ditched IBM’s power hungry
            Power PC architecture as computing performance began to be measured in FLOPS per watt rather than FLOPS alone.
            However, there is another reason Apple’s move to ARM architecture is interesting: ARM CPUs are RISC

            <p class="blog_paragraph"></p>One of the main appeals of the x86 architecture was compatibility with existing software and hardware.
            However, as abstract virtual machines and compatibility layers like Apple’s “Rosetta” dynamic binary translator
            will ease the transition between architectures, there are many other benefits to RISC for personal computing. So what
            are RISC and CISC and how do they differ?</p>

            <h4>What is a CISC and how does it work?</h4>
            <p class="blog_paragraph">CISC stands for (Complete Instruction Set Computer) and they aim to bundle in as many operations as possible
            into a single instruction. This reduces the amount of assembly code which needs
            to be stored in RAM. Let’s take the example of adding two numbers. Let there be two arbitrary CPU registers,
            R0, and R1 which contain some floats we want to add together. A line of CISC assembly would look something like
            this:</p>

            <h6>ADD R0, R1</h6>

            CISC stands for (Complete Instruction Set Computer) and they aim to bundle in as many operations as possible
            into a single instruction. This reduces the amount of assembly code which needs
            to be stored in RAM. Let’s take the example of adding two numbers. Let there be two arbitrary CPU registers,

            machine code looks remarkably similar to the source code. While it may seem simple and strait forward, the "add"
            instruction is actually doing several different things in sequence. The “add” instruction loads the
            values from RAM into the registers, lets the integrated circuits work their adding magic, and then stores the values
            back into RAM. Saving RAM and making compilers and interpreters do less work certainly are nice benefits

            <h4>What does RISC do?</h4>
            <p class="blog_paragraph">RISC instructions do not automatically load or store values into main memory, so values can remain in the
            CPU registers <b>until they are actually ready to be stored in RAM, or overwritten</b>. This can dramatically
            reduce the number of loads and stores a program needs to do at the assembly level.</p>

            <p class="blog_paragraph">Let’s consider the previous example of adding two floats, and that registers R2 and R3 point to memory
            addresses that store the floats we’re adding. The assembly will load, then add, then store the values in the
            following sequence:</p>

                <h6>LOAD R2, R0<br>
                    LOAD R3, R1<br>
                    SUM R0, R1<br>
                    STORE R1, R2</h6>

            <p class="blog_paragraph">While this approach makes it harder for the poor programmer who’s writing a Python interpreter for a RISC
            based CPU, you’ll notice that load and store operations were separated from the addition. Notice that there is room for doing some
            additional arithmetic with the two floats while they’re still in the CPU registers (either directly before or
            directly after the sum). In addition, this eliminates the need for microcode to break down the previous CISC add
            operation into something more resembling the RISC code above.</p>

            limited knowledge on the topic and also so this blog post doesn’t become excessively long. In an age where 16 GB of DDR4 RAM
            is only $60 on Amazon and affordable smartphones have 6 GB of RAM, CISC’s memory saving capabilities seem like a
            pretty useless feature. Also the complexity of 64 bit instructions have blurred the line between RISC and CISC
            so much, that loads and stores are the primary difference between the two. Intel and AMD CPUs already incorporate
            RISC into the x86 instruction set to some degree. Nevertheless, fanboys find a way to fight over just about
            anything, be it Mac Vs Windows, Intel vs AMD, or anything within or outside the world of tech you could possibly
            dream of. While I enjoyed getting to educate myself and readers of my blog about RISC and CISC, Apple’s choice to
            move from x86 to ARM has implications far beyond the scope of this blog post, and I plan on writing more
