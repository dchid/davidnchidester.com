	<p class="blog_paragraph">After more than a year, it’s long past time that I get back in the habit of writing blog posts. The first self-host post was a little lacking, there was so much more that I could include. Here are some additional applications to host on your home server.</p>

	<h4>Gitlab</h4>
	<p class="blog_paragraph">No discredit to Github, but Gitlab is the ultimate self-host git and DevOps automation server! It includes not only CI tools, but CD tools as well. The deployment features blow Jenkins out of the water and it has a sleek, modern UI. You can deploy to nearly any environment such as AWS, Azure, or non-cloud environments. What I like is that because you have both version control and DevOps on a single server, you don’t need to worry about networking between separate git and DevOps servers.</p>

	<h4>Nginx</h4>
	<p class="blog_paragraph">Nginx (pronounced “en-gin-eks”) can be used not only as a standard https server, but also as a mail proxy and reverse http proxy server. If you have a server with a DNS configuration at home and you have security concerns about connecting your server to the public web, Nginx could be useful for connecting your server to the internet more securely than Apache. In the past, I’ve used Nginx to host a DevOps server within a virtual private cloud.</p>

	<h4>Collabora Online</h4>
	<p class="blog_paragraph">It’s the office suite I’m writing this blog post on. Collabora Online is an open source office suite with excellent Nextcloud integration. Although it’s not as full featured as Only Office, you can install it on the same server as your Nextcloud instance from the front end web client. It supports both X86 and ARM, so Raspberry Pi users will be pleased.</p>

	<h4>Samba</h4>
	<p class="blog_paragraph">Although the SMB protocol was designed for Windows, Samba makes it both usable, and hostable on Linux too! Samba is a versatile FOSS implementation of the SMB server so you can create a network fileshare which is cross compatible with nearly every operating system. It handles the discrepancies between POSIX permission bits and Windows ACLs automatically. I created a read only network file share with my music and retro game ROMs on it so that guests can connect anonymously and browse my music collection and my retro game collection.</p>

	<h4>Jellyfin</h4>
	<p class="blog_paragraph">I included Kodi in the previous post, but there are other media servers I’d like to highlight. Jellyfin is a hostable media server for Movies, TV, Music and more. It can be hosted on Docker, Debian based distros like Ubuntu, Redhat based distros, Gentoo, Arch (please don’t do this, rolling releases are unsuitable for servers), Mac OS, and Windows (If anyone out there still uses Windows server). They also have a huge number of clients available on smart TVs, and smartphones. The number of platforms the client supports is to long to list here, so check the website.</p>

	<h4>Plex</h4>
	<p class="blog_paragraph">I know what your thinking right now: isn’t it redundant to recommend three different media servers? While you might think that, Plex does have differences which set it apart. Let’s get the bad news out of the way first; the client end is closed source. A feature you might appreciate though is that has a client app for Playstation and Xbox. Kodi has an app for Xbox, but not Playstastation, while Jellyfin doesn’t have an app for either. Given that the game console is the center of most household’s entertainment systems, this is quite the feature for those who want to stream a movie after their game.</p>

	<h4>Nextcloud Notes</h4>
	One of my personal favorite Nextcloud apps is Nextcloud Notes. It’s a great self hosted alternative to google keep which stores notes in a markdown format. I user it all the time to make shopping lists or other things I’d like to remember.<p class="blog_paragraph"></p>

	<h4>Nextcloud Passwords</h4>
	<p class="blog_paragraph">If you don’t use a password manager yet, you might look into Nextcloud Passwords. It’s more secure than storing passwords in your browser. It uses end to end encryption and lets you organize passwords into folders. Like the other Nextcloud Apps, it can be installed from the Nextcloud web UI.</p>

	<p class="blog_paragraph">I hope I’ve either convinced you that home servers are worthwhile, or gave you some inspiration for how to use an old desktop. I’ve loved using my home server, and I hope you will too.</p>
