            Anyone who knows me well knows how much I love Sacha Baron Cohen. While I was watching an old episode of Da Ali G show, I came across this clip of Ali asking if computers will ever calculate 99999999999... multiplied by 999999... (he goes on saying '9' for about 40 seconds like that stupid avant garde Beatles sound collage <u>Revolution 9</u>).

          <p class="blog_paragraph">
            Despite the fact that this was a joke, three thoughts came to my mind: The first that I should write out a program to time the calculation and see how long it takes my computer to complete. The second was that I hope someone else already transcribed Ali G’s math problem so that I wouldn’t have to waste too much of my time (thankfully someone on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualMath/comments/1pnqns/can_we_solve_ali_gs_math_problems/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> has done it). The third question was how am I going to have high enough precision to store those numbers in memory. That last one is the topic of this blog post. One might ask how any 64 bit computer can store a number larger than 2^64 - 1, and the answer is arbitrary precision arithmetic.
          </p>
          <h4>So what is arbitrary precision arithmetic and why is it important?</h4>
          <p class="blog_paragraph">
            Arbitrary precision arithmetic (which I’ll refer to as APA for short) is when computers are able to store and calculate numbers with as much precision as they can fit in memory. For example, think about a data type in C such as the unsigned char. It can represent values between 0 and 255; a full byte of memory. Here we have a byte of memory storing the number 122 in binary or a lowercase 'z' in ASCII.</p>
          <table style="color: black;">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <td style="background-color: white;">0</td>
                <td style="background-color: white;">1</td>
                <td style="background-color: white;">1</td>
                <td style="background-color: white;">1</td>
                <td style="background-color: white;">1</td>
                <td style="background-color: white;">0</td>
                <td style="background-color: white;">1</td>
                <td style="background-color: white;">0</td>
              </tr>
            </thead>
          </table>
          <p class="blog_paragraph">
            We're all set until we add 134+122=256 and get an overflow, looping back to 0. <em>Note: in reality this won’t actually happen in C because as of C11, unsigned operands can never overflow, but let’s pretend that they do.</em> We can solve this problem by switching to a higher precision data type like an integer, but then what happens when that’s not enough? What if even an unsigned long is insufficient? At a low level, that certainly won’t suffice to store the numbers in Ali’s math problem. Will we have to continuously invent larger and larger data types in C? The answer is no, because C and most other languages have libraries for arbitrary precision integers and floats which allow us to use as many bytes as needed to store a number.
          </p>
          <h4>How does it work?</h4>
          <p class="blog_paragraph">
            As one might expect, the most simple implementations of APA just allocate more memory for higher precision. Bytes are nothing more than an ordered collection of 8 bits. To store larger integers, one need only create a larger collection of bits. Floats are a little bit different, (no pun intended). The IEEE defines a double as using 1 bit for sign, 11 bits for the exponent, and 52 bits for the mantissa making 64 bits in total.

          <p class="blog_paragraph">
            Most implementations of AP floats will allow AP for the mantissa, but allocate a fixed number of bits for the exponent, because allowing infinite bits for both would simply be too complicated. This is great for storing irrational numbers but there is an even more efficient way to store rationals. All rational numbers by definition, can be expressed as an integer divided by another integer, so many APA implementations will simply store the numbers as a numerator denominator pair and have I/O functions like printing display a variable number of radices. For example, the number 4/3 can simply be stored as the integers 4 and 3, and when printing the number, we can simply print 1.33333333... up to the programmer’s desired precision. This saves a lot of memory over traditional AP floats with variable precision mantissas.
          </p>
          <h4>What implementations exist?</h4>
          <p class="blog_paragraph">
            There are myriad libraries for APA in popular programming languages. At a low Level, GNU has a library called GNU multiple precision (GMP) for C and C++. Java has the classes BigInteger and BigDecimal included in the standard library. Some languages like Haskell and Python have APA built in by default. Python uses APA for integers by default and has a module called decimal for AP floats.
          </p>
          <h4>What are practical use cases for APA?</h4>
          <p class="blog_paragraph">
            The most important area APA is used is in Cryptography. Anyone who has taken a look at a TLS certificate knows that encryption keys can get very very large. The public key for this site is 2048 bits long, which even when encoded in base 64 is still a lot of characters. With some TLS and SSL certificates being half a kilobyte (in terms of key size, file size can get much larger), being able to process very large integers is a must for programs like open-ssh or pen testing tools.
          </p>
          <p class="blog_paragraph">
            Besides cryptography, mathematicians use APA to calculate very high precision constants. A far more interesting use for APA than Ali G’s math problem (or "maths problem" because he’s British &#x1F1EC;&#x1F1E7;) is calculating digits of &#960;. Since &#960; is irrational, we would need infinite precision to truly represent it's actual value, but mathematicians who approximate &#960; can use APA in their programs to calculate millions of digits of &#960;. The Chudnofsky algorithm is one of the most efficient ways to calculate &#960; and is based on Srinivasa Ramanujan’s rapidly convergent &#960; Series. Without APA, only so many digits can be calculated, but using AP floats, we are limited only by how much memory we have. The world record for calculating digits of &#960; at the time of my writing is over 50 Trillion! Certainly can’t store that in a double. Another example used in mathematics is for calculating fractals like the famous Mandelbrot set. APA allows programmers to compute ever more detailed fractals.

            I hope this was a fun and educational blog post. If you take away anything from it, I hope you learned that Sacha Baron Cohen is a comedic genius. JK, not really. I hope it made you think about how computer scientists create encryption keys, and how mathematicians computed 50 trillion digits of &#960;. Until next time, stay curious!
