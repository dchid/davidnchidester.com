<body style="background-color: black;">
  <p class="blog_paragraph">I was recently speaking with a cyber security professional about
      DevSecOps at a neworking event. Upon asking if they’ve heard of
      Jenkins which prompted a response “That lousy butler? We’ve been
      trying to get people to ditch it for years!”. The remainder of our
      conversation was consumed by our mutual frustration with Jenkins.
      I’ve never loathed any piece of software more than Microsoft’s NT
      Kernel, but a close a very close second would have to be Jenkins,
      which brings me to the topic of this blog post: ten reasons Jenkins
      is the worst DevOps automation server ever, and what DevOps engineers
      should use instead. Least anyone misunderstand, the purpose of this
      article isn’t to vent my frustrations at Jenkins, but rather to use
      Jenkins as a case study for everything DevOps engineers shouldn’t
      do, and thus, provide a counter-example of what a fast, secure, and
      reliable CI/CD pipeline looks like.</p>

<ul>
  <li><h4>UI</h4></li>
</ul>
<p class="blog_paragraph">
The UI is the least of Jenkin’s problems, yet it’s impossible not
to note how it looks like a WebApp from 1999. Asthetics aside,
Jenkins’ UI is unresponsive, its menus are difficult to navigate
and it takes 3-4 clicks and page refreshes to actually navigate to
the content you need. The fact that one of the most popular plugins
for Jenkins is a complete UI overhaul tells you how archaic the UI
truly is.</p>
<br/>

<ul>
  <li><h4>Scalability</h4></li>
</ul>
<p class="blog_paragraph">As software grows and the number of
CI, CD, and CT pipelines become more numerous, you’d expect a
DevOps automation server to scale in parallel. Unfortunately Jenkins
is not up to the task. Running jobs on the master node is extremely
insecure, and setting up additional worker nodes it not easy, nor is
scaling down when few deployments are running. You expected Jenkins
to work with Kubernetes out of the box and provision worker nodes on
demand? Think again! Simply getting Jenkins to work with docker is
already a headache.</span></p>
<br/>

</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Java WebApp</h4></li>
</ul>
<p class="blog_paragraph">
Java was intended to be the “write once, run anywhere”
platform, but in practice it’s more like “write once debug
everywhere”. Java’s abstract VM/semi-compiled approach tried to
solve most of the compatibility issues which are better addressed by
containerization and virtualization today. The JVM certainly has its
place, but if December 2021’s log4j vulnerability and Java
“applets” have taught us anything, it’s that Java isn’t the
best or most secure platform for developing web apps. Cross platform
compatibility isn't even prioritized as it’s almost guaranteed that
any web app in 2023 is hosted on Linux. I’m astonished that the
Jenkins development team is even still releasing Windows binaries.</p>
<br/>

</p>
<ul>
	<li><h4>Updates</h4></li>
</ul>
<p class="blog_paragraph">
Jenkins sure isn’t very modern for a web-app which releases a new
version <b>on a weekly basis!</b>
Even if you install the LTS release, the updates come every four
weeks and is still buggy and prone to crashing. I understand that
security updates are important, but the release cycle really needs to
be slowed down. Development teams rely on being able to deploy code
to production on schedule, and should ever have their CD pipelines
bottlenecked because Jenkins crashed after the most recent update.</p>
<br/>

<ul>
  <li><h4>No SaaS Option</h4></li>
</ul>
Not all teams have the Sys-Admin resources to manage a secure CI/CD
pipeline, which is why Software as a Service (or SaaS as it’s more
commonly known) is an appealing option over self hosting for many
teams. Jenkins doesn’t offer this. It requires often multiple
full-time DevOps professionals to manage a Jenkins server for
multiple teams, and you can only expect more issues as more pipelines
are created.</p>
<br/>

</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Poor Containerization</h4></li>
</ul>
<p class="blog_paragraph">
Jenkins was developed before containerization became the solution to 
resolving dependency issues. The poor support for Docker makes Jenkins 
even more difficult to scale, and even less secure. Someone once 
suggested to me that individual teams should run their own Jenkins 
containers and delegate one person per team to be the “Jenkins Admin”, 
but that creates an immense amount of overhead.
</p>
<br/>

<ul>
  <li><h4>XML Database</h4></li>
</ul>
<p class="blog_paragraph">
I genuinely have no clue what the Jenkins developers were thinking
when they thought using XML files for a database was a good idea.
Someone could hack the Jenkins user database with a simple stream
editor! Jenkins could have used MySQL, MariaDB, or Postgres as a
dependency, but no, the Jenkins dev team thought XML was the best
solution.</p>
<br>

<ul>
  <li><h4>Self Service Model</h4></li>
</ul>
<p class="blog_paragraph">
Telling people “no” never feels good, but tough love is necessary
when there are so many ways an inexperienced user can compromise a
Jenkins server. Even when users aren’t doing anything wrong, having
multiple teams simply creating folders and projects makes finding and
organizing pipelines a herculean task. Since it lacks so much
functionality without plugins, users are always inclined to request
to install dozens of them. System administrators will review requests
and ask users “do you really need this plugin to deploy your code?”
and the sad part is that they often do, and often aren’t mindful of
how many xss vulnerabilities an average Jenkins plugin has, speaking
of which...</p>
<br>

<ul>
  <li><h4>Plugins</h4></li>
</ul>
<p class="blog_paragraph">
Jenkins has an enormous and unregulated plugin ecosystem, which gives
it functionality it should have without any plugins at all. These
plugins are not from upstream repositories audited by Jenkins and
installed by a package manager; it’s a cacophony of features and
add-ons, half of which aren’t even actively maintained. The more
plugins installed on a server, the more vulnerable a server is.</p>
<br>

<ul>
  <li><h4>System Administration</h4></li>
</ul>
<p class="blog_paragraph">
The worst part of hosting a Jenkins server by far is how much time
and resources it consumes simply to maintain. If you want to run a
Jenkins server (which I sincerely hope you don’t, especially after
reading this article) you absolutely need a full time “Jenkins guy”
to manage it. Any automation which Jenkins provides isn’t worth the
amount of time and expertise it requires to maintain a Jenkins server.
Be prepared to work nights and weekends to figure out why a worker
node keeps crashing, and why logins are broken after installing the
latest update.</p>
<br>

<p class="blog_paragraph">
What qualities should one look for in a DevOps tool? A good DevOps
tool is everything that Jenkins isn’t. It’s stable, it’s
scalable, it’s secure, it requires minimal administration, it’s
supposed to make continuous deployment easy! It would be far easier
and dare I say it, even more secure, to manually copy and paste source
code from github directly into your production environment then to
create a Jenkins job to “automate” the process. There are so many
amazing DevOps automation tools to use instead of Jenkins, that they
deserve a blog post of their own. Stay tuned my next blog entry for
an in depth review of all of the excellent options you <b>should</b>
use for your CI/CD pipelines.</p>
