                        throughout my career there. I started working in DevOps as a System Administrator for two
                        DevOps automation servers running Jenkins. I provisioned resources at an OS level, configuring
                        DNS, SSL/TLS and containers, and helped development teams manage their pipelines for CD/CT. I
                        also worked extensively with multiple AWS services, AWS CLI, and boto3 (AWS Python SDK).

                        When there was a reorganization of teams at Thermo Fisher, I moved from the DevOps team to
                        the platform engineering team so the company could leverage my skills as a programmer.
                        I created a python SDK for transferring files between Microsoft SharePoint and an S3 datalake
                        which was featured in a post on

                        I also worked a serverless application to automatically tag
                        new resources created in AWS with the email of the user or the IAM role who provisioned them,
                        along with other relevant information. I also worked on a project to encrypt every unencrypted
                        EBS volume in several AWS accounts using boto3.
