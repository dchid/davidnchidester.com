				    The numeral base converter is a command line utility I designed to convert numbers
                                    between different numeral bases. For example, it can convert numerals between
                                    binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal but also more unusual bases (like base 3 for
                                    example). Like Java's Integer.parseInt() method, it will work with any base between
                                    2 and 16 inclusive. This project started as a lab for my architecture and compilers
                                    course at Willamette University, but I've modified it as a CLI application designed
                                    to be piped to other CLI apps. Check it out on my Github.

                                    The longest common DNA subsequence started as a project in my algorithms course
                                    which has since been expanded It can find the longest common subsequence between two
                                    DNA sequences, find compliment bases, and convert DNA to Messenger RNA. I've found
                                    this project particularly interesting after I started working in biotech.

                                    At Thermo Fisher Scientific, I collaborated with other software engineers to make it
                                    easier to request resources to be provisioned.
                                    We created a resource provisioning request form with Microsoft PowerApps and
                                    published <a class="text-light"

                                    automated self service platform.

                                    Data engineering teams at Thermo Fisher Scientific needed a tool to migrate CSV
                                    files in Microsoft SharePoint into their S3 datalake.
                                    I created a custom python module to automate the process using Microsoft's Graph API
                                    and the AWS S3 SDK.
                                    The project saved data engineering teams over 250 hours of labor annually. I
                                    co-authored a blog post on the project on the official AWS blog
