            <p class="blog_paragraph">Apple recently announced their new line of ARM powered Macs, which will be the first Macs without Intel CPUs
            in over a decade. I recall seeing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwIUNbrjS9I" target="_blank">commercial</a> when
            Apple first began their partnership with Intel. It claimed that Intel CPUs were stuck inside “dull little boxes”
            preforming “dull little tasks”, and that the Intel CPU would “finally be set free” inside a Mac. I mean no
            disrespect to anyone who works in marketing or advertising, but this seemed to be standard
            marketing BS. Call me cynical, but I think that’s every advertiser’s job; to spew a bunch of meaningless nonsense in
            people’s faces to convince them to buy your good or service. All this reminds me of award shows. People act
            as if they’re both celebrations of excellence and achievement, and also competitions for who has achieved the
            most. In reality, award shows like the Oscars and Grammys are neither of those things, they’re just glorified
            advertisements.</p>

            <p class="blog_paragraph">I’m getting a little off topic here. After all, this blog post isn’t about cynicism towards advertising and
            marketing, it’s about ARM CPUs. As Apple has switched their partners in CPU architecture from Motorola to
            IBM, from IBM to Intel, and now from Intel to ARM, I can’t help but feel that for years the ARM CPU has been
            stuck doing dull little tasks in dull little boxes, just like in that commercial. Now however, Apple has the
            opportunity to change that.</p>

            <p class="blog_paragraph">Call me a geek (I refer to myself as a geek after all) but the iPad and iPhone are pretty dull little boxes
            to me. They’re limited immensely by their OS, their closed off ecosystem, and general use as "consumption"
            devices. With the exception of creative writers and illustrators, people are using these devices to consume media
            rather than create it. I’m more interested in seeing people create complex linear regression models on an ARM chip,
            than seeing people gawk at frivolous garbage on snapchat and facebook. Apple’s M1 SOC has the power to change that.</p>

            <p class="blog_paragraph">For the unacquainted, advanced risk machines or “ARM” is a micro-architecture company and instruction set
            predominantly used in smartphones and tablets. ARM uses reduced instruction set computing or “RISC”
            technology which separates load and store operations as separate op-codes from logical and arithmetic operations. This
            approach has many advantages and drawbacks from a CISC instruction set, but one of the greatest benefits is
            that ARM offers far more performance per watt than Intel’s x86. I made a whole blog post on RISC vs CISC below
            which you can read for more technical details. Unlike Intel, ARM doesn’t manufacture chips themselves. Instead,
            they license their architecture and instruction set to hardware manufactures like Samsung, Qualcomm, NVIDIA, and
            yes... Apple to make their own “systems on a chip”, more commonly referred to as SOCs.</p>

            <p class="blog_paragraph">There have been multiple, largely unsuccessful attempts to bring the ARM instruction set to Windows PCs and
            other desktop operating systems. Anyone else remember the short-lived and disappointing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_RT" target="_blank">Windows RT</a>?
            However, Apple could finally achieve something substantial with its new M1 SOC. Apple introduced it’s new line of M1 powered Macs with the same
            marketing mumbo-jumbo it used in 2006, complete with a meaningless line graph with an unlabeled Y-axis.</p>

            <img class="centered" alt="M1 graph" src="../images/blog/m1_line_graph.jpg"><br>
            <span style="margin-left: 5%;">Image source from apple.com/mac/m1/</span><br><br>

            <p class="blog_paragraph">But don’t write off the M1 just yet, because behind all of the marketing lies some serious potential. If
            Apple doesn’t lock down the bootloader with an iron fist (which they very well might) these new M1 macs could be a
            huge boon for developers. One could install Linux on these machines and develop compile the Linux kernel for
            ARM CPUs on an ARM machine, kind of like a supercharged raspberry pi pinebook. Even if they do lock down the
            bootloader, the ability to finally develop IOS and Android applications on an ARM computer will allow
            developers to test their code on the same hardware that it will run on, no VM, compatibility layer, or cloud
            environment necessary. Given that we’re using ARM more and more in our every day lives, I want the flexibility to
            develop code on the same hardware my code will run on. Some PC enthusiasts have scoffed at the M1, and derided it as
            an iPhone on steroids. Windows users especially have said that macs are going to become nothing more than
            oversized iPhones, incapable of running all of the applications and games that have been compiled for x86. In their
            defense, they’re probably right. Apple probably won’t want to take advantage of this opportunity to make ARM
            computing as awesome as it could be, and they won’t want to let others take advantage of this opportunity
            either. That being said, I think the Windows fanboys are missing the point. CISC computers were made for a
            time when memory was scarce and super expensive, and chip makers needed to squeeze as much assembly code as they
            could into as little space as possible. Apple has focused on dramatically reducing the number of times data
            needs to be loaded from memory to CPU registers, creating really fast integrated memory to expedite loads
            and stores when they are necessary, and completely eliminating the need for micro-code. Just look at what
            Nintendo was able to achieve with the ARM-based NVIDIA Tegra x1 soc. They got the full, fat version of Unreal Engine
            4 running on the Nintendo Switch, so I can play Doom Eternal on a device that fits in my jacket pocket. That’s
            crazy awesome!</p>

            <p class="blog_paragraph">I admit I have my own biases as a Linux fanboy, but I’ve always been bothered by the complacency of the
            Windows PC market. The NT Kernel is so fundamentally flawed, that I almost can’t believe any developer even
            begrudgingly tolerates it. Perhaps its time to admit that x86, the most widely used computer architecture in the world,
            has hit many of its limits, and it’s time to make an admittedly difficult transition to something better. Apple
            has a history of implementing things which are struggling to gain popularity in the PC market, and then making
            it popular. Think about, GUIs, trackpads, smartphones, tablets, keyboard cases, removing headphone jacks, and
            USB type C. Apple didn’t invent any of these things, nor were they the first implement them in a product sold to
            consumers, but they did make all of these things popular. This is what makes me so excited about the M1 SOC.
            It could finally bring ARM support to desktop operating systems, freeing them from these dull little boxes, and
            getting ARM CPUs to do something amazing.</p>
