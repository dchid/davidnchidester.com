            For the last several decades, the standard desktop GUI has looked something like this: a desktop wallpaper
            with colorful icons, and rectangular windows layered on top of the desktop and each other. This familiar setup is
            called a “floating window manager” and you may be using one as you read this right now. But are floating
            window managers really the best solution for everyone? The most frequently used computers today, smartphones, don’t
            typically use tiling window managers. Should we really be using standard desktop environments simply because
            Microsoft and Apple copied a GUI design from Xerox before many of the people reading this were even born? A
            popular alternative has arisen in the form of the tiling window manager. Tiling WMs such as i3, Awesome WM,
            and Xmonad have garnered popularity within the GNU Linux community due to their simplicity and innovation. How
            they work is simple. Instead of having overlapping rectangular windows layered on top of each other, tiling WMs
            subdivide a rectangular screen into spaced for the rectangular windows, meaning no windows will ever be
            layered on top of each other. Since this can be a little difficult to picture, you can see my personal setup bellow.</p>
            <img src="../images/blog/i3_wm_example.png" width="90%" height="auto" alt="my i3 setup" class="centered">
            <p class="blog_paragraph">Why might this be appealing? I came up with four benefits to using a tiling wm instead of a traditional floating WM:
            <ul>
                <li>Firstly, It’s space efficient. Tiling WMs ensure that every part of the screen save for a status bar
                    and margins is used for displaying a window. A floating WM will often have much of the screen going unused by
                    partially covered windows or space that isn’t covered by a window at all. In contrast, a tiling window manager
                    covers every part of the screen that can be used. If only one window is open, that window will be full
                    screen. Especially as ultrawide monitors become more popular and display resolution keeps increasing,
                    utilizing that extra screen real estate can be a significant advantage for anyone using a tiling WM.</li>
                <li>Tiling WMs are also very visually pleasing. There is an entire subreddit called Unix Porn dedicated
                    to displaying beautiful UIs many of which use tiling WMs (and yes despite the vulgar name, it is very
                    much SFW). Tiling WMs look unique to the average non-technical person who will likely be surprised that a
                    computer UI could even look like anything other than the generic desktop they’re no doubt accustomed to. The ability
                    to customize a tiling WM with different colors, margins, and backgrounds can do a great deal to enhance a UI’s
                    aesthetics.</li>
                <li>For those more concerned with utilitarianism rather than aesthetics, a tiling WM will often use far
                    less RAM and other computing resources than a traditional floating WM. Xmonad and i3 use far fewer resources that
                    gnome shell and traditional desktop environments, which creates a noticeable increase in speed when preforming
                    routine tasks.</li>
                <li>For command line junkies like myself, tiling WMs also reduce reliance on using a mouse. While most
                    users will inevitably want to use a mouse using a keyboard to interact with a GUI, cli can be just as quick and in
                    some cases, quicker than using a mouse.</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p class="blog_paragraph">
            Tiling WMs are not only gaining popularity on Unix like operating systems, but on Windows and Mac OS as
            well. Microsoft recently released a tiling window manager called fancy zones as a part of its new “power toys”
            suite of programs. It’s an official release from Microsoft and allows Windows users to rapidly stitch between
            tiling and floating windows. A third-party tiling WM called chunkywm is available on Mac OS.</p>
            <p class="blog_paragraph">Tiling WMs certainly aren’t for everyone; they have a steep learning curve and appeal primarily to computer
            enthusiasts who take pride in customizing their UIs to something suited exactly for them. It is however,
            time to reconsider the dominance of bloated GUIs and floating WMs on traditional PCs ask if we are over
            reliant on them. One thing I can say with confidence is that I like my setup with i3, and I’ve been able to
            enjoy using my computer more when I don’t have bloated GUIs in my way.</p>
